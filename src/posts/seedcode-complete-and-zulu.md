ZeroBlue is proud to offer **[SeedCode Complete](https://www.seedcode.com/cp-app/ste_cat/sccomplete11)** as our starter solution that we can build upon. If you already have a FileMaker solution, we can simply bolt on a **SeedCode Calendar**. [Contact us](../contact.html) for pricing.

##### Why is this good for me?

Because we can save time and money by not having to start from scratch. SeedCode Complete offers contact, project, invoice management and calendar events out of the box. You can schedule resources and even view gantt charts of your project.

##### Can I access my calendar events from iCal?

Yes, that’s where [**SeedCode****Zulu**](https://www.seedcode.com/cp-app/ste_cat/zulu) comes into play. Zulu is an extension for FileMaker Server that lets you see and manipulate your FileMaker calendar records from **iCal** , **Google Calendar** , as well as from the calendars on your **iPhone** , **iPad** , and **Android** phone.

##### Can I access FileMaker contacts from my phone?

[![FileMaker contacts on the iPhone, iPod and iPad and Android phones](/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mac-address-book-288x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mac-address-book.jpg)

Zulu Contacts lets you sync your contacts between a FileMaker database and your mobile device. This is amazing. Finally, you can share a group of contacts between a team and have all their data be stored in FileMaker, but take them on the road with your iOS device. You can edit a contact on your iPhone on the road and it will sync back to FileMaker.
