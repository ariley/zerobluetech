[threefourths]

Growing up, Jacques always enjoyed working with computers, and started doing graphic design when he was 16. From there he began web development at 18, and FileMaker development at 19. Since then he has continued enhancing his skills in both areas and is now “fluent” in HTML5, CSS3, PHP, MySQL, Javascript and jQuery.

He and his family live in the Atlanta area, and he spends a lot of his free time training and learning. He has a real passion for Web Development, and technology in general.
