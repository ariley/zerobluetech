This is exactly how I envisioned my application over a year ago, when I started working on it with some developer friends, except one or two EXTRA features, which I am not going to elaborate on.

[Evernote](https://www.evernote.com "Evernote"), however is an excellent application for collecting notes from the web or your head and then syncing them automatically to different platforms, such as your iPhone. I have already made a nice [FileMaker-related notebook](https://www.evernote.com/pub/ariley/FileMaker) on my Mac desktop app from different sources. The information can be tagged and is searchable, as well as you can email notes as PDFs automatically. Two thumbs up, Evernote!

In the image below you can see my collection of FileMaker-related notes:
