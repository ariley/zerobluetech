#### A lot of people ask: can we run FileMaker on Android?

Well, not natively, but that doesn’t mean you cannot get access to FileMaker data.

I’m going to list a few options. Of course, you can always run down to your local Apple Store and grab an iPad Mini and then all your problems will be solved. Plus you get to use Messages and talk to all your iPhone owner friends for free. If this doesn’t tickle your fancy, here are your options:  
  
**Option 1** : Set up a 2X Server. I know just the guy for that. Then you can access your database (or someone else’s) through a Windows and a real FileMaker Pro install. Will it be readable? Well, that depends on your screen size. We tested this on an Android Asus tablet some time ago. See the video:

  
**Option 2** : Have a web developer (e.g. us) create a web application that gets your data posted from FM to the web and load that in a browser. We can even sync your data with MirrorSync from 360works.com.

**Option 3** : Upgrade to FileMaker 13 and use WebDirect to show your data in a browser. Now, I know what you’re thinking. This product is brand new. Is it buggy? Well, it might need more beefier web server than what you might have at the moment and being new we will discover bugs as we use it, but it’s a viable option.  
  
But then again choosing the right option is choosing the right city to raise your kids in: requires some research and conversation.
