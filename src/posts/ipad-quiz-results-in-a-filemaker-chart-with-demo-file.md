All of you who have taken my iPad Quiz probably wondered where the results went. Well, I’ve been busy and most of you probably pre-ordered an iPad by now, but here are the results anyway. I am also including a demo FileMaker file to see how the results were charted. The data comes from the same source table, hence the anomalies on the charts.
