Have you seen one of these square garbled-looking images before? You may have seen them on a subway poster or at an airline boarding pass or on mailers. This article will give you a little background on what they are and how they can be useful to you and your company.

### What is a QR Code?

> A **QR code** (abbreviation for  _Quick Response code_) is a specific matrix barcode (or two-dimensional code) that is readable by dedicated [QR barcode readers](https://zerobluetech.com/koamtac-kdc300i-2d-wireless-bluetooth-barcode-scanner/) and camera telephones. The code consists of black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background. The information encoded may be text, URL, or other data. [Wikipedia]

According to Wikipedia,

> the technology has seen frequent use in Japan, The Netherlands and [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea"), while the West has been slower in the adoption of QR codes.

I got a box of KitKat last summer from Japan (thanks, Shin) that had a QR code on it. It’s slowly but surely picking up on the East Coast, as well. E.g. BJs and other companies are using them on their savings cards.

#### Barcodes vs. QR-Codes

**Picture of a Traditional Barcode**

QR-Codes have become more popular than the typical barcode as the typical barcode can only hold about of 20 digits, whereas the **QR-Code can hold up to 7,089 characters**. This makes the use and diversity of QR-Codes much more appealing than their older counter part, the barcode.

Partially part of the reason QR-Codes can hold more data, is because if you compare a typical barcode to a QR-Code, you can see one major difference; barcodes only span horizontally whereas QR-Codes can span both horizontally and vertically.

#### Position

A great feature of QR-Codes is that you do not need to scan them from one particular angle. QR-Codes are capable of omnidirectional (360 degree’s) high-speed reading. QR-Codes scanners are capable of determining the correct way to decode the content within the QR-Code due to the three specific squares that are positioned in the corners of the symbol.

#### Generating QR Codes

There are a number of [web sites](https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=generate+qr+code) for generating QR codes and most services they offer for free. You can also generate QR Codes with Google Charts or right in a FileMaker database, which we will demo at [Devcon](https://zerobluetech.com/news/come-to-booth-28-to-get-your-vcard-qr-code-label/). The demo database uses the ScriptMaster plug-in from [360 Works](https://www.360works.com/ScriptMaster) and some java goodies put to use by Scott Shackelford at [AEON Development Group](https://www.aeonmedia.com/).
