[threefourths]

A native and resident of Hungary, Robert has applied his talent in many professions, from printing to journalism, from event organizing and sports management, from delivering proofs of concept to managing post-launch operations.

Since chess is his favorite hobby, logic and strategy are not foreign to him. And because the future is all about computing, he found his way into the continuously evolving world of technology. In his free time he serves as a referee at chess tournaments, plays soccer and enjoys boxing.

He started to work for ZeroBlue in the autumn of 2011 as developer and is certified in FileMaker 10 and 13.
