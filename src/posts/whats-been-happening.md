Hello All,

We’ve gone through some transformation. We moved to California! We still strive to continue to serve the entire country.

We are still doing most everything we’ve done before: hosting, development, and sales. We take on special clients now mostly for maintenance work and web integration, but if you have a project in mind feel free to talk to us, and given we capacity we’d be happy to work with you.[![](/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2AD29D4C-40A0-4459-9ACF-C9F495CB9D83_1_105_c-300x300.jpeg)](/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2AD29D4C-40A0-4459-9ACF-C9F495CB9D83_1_105_c.jpeg)

Agnes has acquired an adorable Australian Cattle Dog Mix puppy, who has become an integral part of the team.

We have been quite busy lately (lots of web integration with FMBetterForms), hence the lack of blog posts, but due to popular demand, we promise to do better in the future.

We are also working on catching up on some certifications, but we’ve been learning Javascript and working with Postman for web integrations. [Talk to us about it!](../contact.html)

We’ve been staying safe practicing good social and hygiene habits. Hope you’ve been, too!
